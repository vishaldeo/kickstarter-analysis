# Overview of Project


Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, our customer ( Louise )  wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we can visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
Client wants trends of theaters and plays to determine the successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns.

# Analysis and Challenges


## Analysis on Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart 

For the first deliverable `Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart`  clients need the data by the Theater category. I created the Pivot table for Outcome based on launchdate. 
We created 2 filters by Category and Year ( The derived columns based on the data provided ). For a selected year and the category we can predict the campaign outcomes. 
The rows shows the month for the given year selected for a Category and columns consist the campaign status ( Failed, successful, cancelled). 
As per the chart analysis , we can confirm that the May and June are the best campaign which have successful results. We noticed that May and June months have maximum theater campaign.
